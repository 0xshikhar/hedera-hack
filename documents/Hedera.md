Track 4: AI and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN)

link - https://hedera-hackathon.hashgraph.swiss/tools#track4

Integrating AI with decentralized networks to create intelligent, autonomous systems for global infrastructure.

Supported by Hashgraph Online
Supported by Hashgraph Online
Use Cases
AI Integration: Developing AI agents for secure decision-making in healthcare, finance, or smart cities

Global DePIN Solutions: Creating networks for decentralized internet, energy, or services

AI-Based Economic Systems: Optimizing tokenomics and rewards in DePIN using AI

Autonomous DAOs: AI systems that analyze proposal impacts, participate in governance voting based on predefined criteria, and automatically execute decisions while maintaining transparency through immutable records

Identity Verification Networks: AI systems that verify identities across platforms, detect fraud patterns, and maintain reputation scores while preserving user privacy

Proposed Themes
Create a Custom Plugin for the Hedera Agent Kit
Extend the Hedera agent kit and add custom functionality which interacts with your own Smart Contracts or data. Let the AI Agent use the plugin in either autonomous or return bytes (human in the loop) mode.

Resources:
ðŸ“š Plugin Documentation
Contribute to the Hedera Agent Kit
Add additional core functionality, write an adapter to provide support for new AI Agent Frameworks, or improve the documentation / examples!
